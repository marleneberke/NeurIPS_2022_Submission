These images show examples of how hallucinations are not actually Poisson distributed as they are not independent of one another, but instead show some spatial clumping. In these images, RetinaNet hallucinated TVs clumped together.

This is qualitative evidence that the Poisson distribution is not overfit to the patterns of hallucinations, as a Poisson cannot describe this pattern of hallucinations.
